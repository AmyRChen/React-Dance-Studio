## AC Dance Studio Website

This is a website for a dance studio that I built to learn Tailwind CSS. As a dance enthusiast, I came up with the idea of creating a static website to introduce the dance studio to others.

Production: https://react-dance-studio-app-amyrchen.vercel.app/
- Environment: JavaScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Vercel

### I have an idea to redesign this webpage...
This website used to be my portfolio. As I would like to recreate my portfolio after I graduated, I plan to redesign this application with a idea with dance studio.

Idea:

1. Edit the color of the navigation and footers color/ background colorâ€¦ 
2. Landing page: dancing video
